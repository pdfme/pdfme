## Cloud Service Option

While pdfme is a powerful open-source library, we understand that some users might prefer a managed solution. For those looking for a ready-to-use, scalable PDF generation service without the hassle of setup and maintenance, we offer pdfme Cloud.

pdfme Cloud provides all the features of the open-source library, plus:

- PDF generation at scale without infrastructure management

- Automatic updates and maintenance

*pdfme will always remain open source. The cloud service is an optional offering for those who prefer a managed solution.*
